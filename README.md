# NewsApp---Fetch-Latest-News-Articles-Using-NewsAPI

PROJECT DISCRIPTUON

# NewsApp

NewsApp is a simple Java-based application that allows users to fetch and display the latest news articles from the web using the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). Users can search for news articles based on specific keywords, such as "football" or "Cristiano Ronaldo," and the application will return related news headlines.

This project demonstrates how to work with REST APIs in Java, handle HTTP connections, and parse JSON responses. The app can be easily extended to include more advanced features, such as filtering by language, country, or news source.

## Features
- Fetch news articles by entering any keyword (e.g., "Sports,Business,Technology").
- Simple command-line interface for searching news articles.
